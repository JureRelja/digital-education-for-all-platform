  parahraph1: `The Holland Occupational Themes is a theory of personality that focuses on career and vocational choice. It groups people based on their suitability for six different categories of occupations. The six types yield the RIASEC acronym, by which the theory is also commonly known. John L. Holland developed the theory over the course of his career, starting in the 1950s. The typology has come to dominate the field of career counseling and has been incorporated into most of the popular assessments used in the field.`,
  parahraph2: `You can easily identify your interests and what would you like to do. Three letters from the acronym R-I-A-S-E-C with the highest value means your three-letter summary code. It is the most concise and understandable way, how to describe the combination of your interest.`,
  paragraph3: `To get your RIASEC code, mark your interest (YES or NO) in each
    described activity. Do not worry about whether you have the skills or
    training to do an activity, or how much money you might make; just
    think about whether you would enjoy doing it or not.`,
  paragraph4: `You will see your RIASEC summary code and its meaning after finishing
    the questionnaire.`,
